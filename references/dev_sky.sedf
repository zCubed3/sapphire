# In Sapphire an asset reference can and will be swapped out with a reference to the "optimized" asset
# This is on purpose, to avoid using an expensive file that is meant for modification, and instead only for reading
# e.g. the source below will be replaced with a reference to the path's hash
# The cached files will detect if the asset has changed before loading it though!

# You must set the x and y offsets per face like so
# But also must set the size of 1 face
