# Sapphire Engine Data File
#

# This is a draft of the "Sapphire Engine Data File" or "SEDF" syntax

#
# Data Types aka "Archetypes"
#

# These are registered on the C++ side
# They're paths (with :: accessors like C++)

# An instance of a type is created with an arrow (like a pointer accessor), "->"
# Omitting the -> will lead to modifying the global instance
# This is used for types that have no purpose being instanced, e.g. config files
# Instances will have their names kept intact if requested by the engine
# If it is not requested then the engine uses the hash, which is faster an smaller for built games!

# Example 1
[Sapphire::EngineConfig]
# ...

# Example 2
[Sapphire::Texture->DevTexture]
# ...

#
# Member data types
#

# "i" = "integer"
#
# Ex: 10

# "f" = "float"
#
# Ex: 10.0

# "n" = "number" (float or integer)
#
# Ex: 12
# or...
# Ex: 3.1415

# "b" = "boolean"
#
# Ex: true

# "s" = "string"
#
# Ex: "Hello, World!"

# "e" = "enum"
#
# Ex: Shape2D

# "r" = "ref" (more commonly written as ref)
#
# Ex: "engine://cube.smdl"

#
# The "ref" aka "r" type
#

# This is a URL inspired string like so...
refSource = "dev_chunk://dev_tex.png"

# The first part of the reference defines the origin
# So whatever the engine has mounted to "dev_chunk" is the base of the path
# After :// we then specify the asset name
# In this case, dev_tex.png

#
# Data Segments
#

# This is a complete piece of data that the engine will parse, cache, and use / release when needed
# It is constructed using the following syntax
#
# Do note, sometimes data instances will have instances of their own
# This is commonly seen on cubemaps
# You access this using the accessor, aka ::
#
# 1) The "archetype"
# 2) Members

# Example 1
#
# Creating a 2D texture for usage within the engine
[Sapphire::Texture->DevTexture]
eShape = Shape2D

refSource = "dev_chunk://dev_tex.png"

# Example 2
#
# Creating a cubemap texture for usage within the engine
[Sapphire::Texture->DevSky]
eShape = ShapeCube

[Sapphire::Texture->DevSky::Left]
refSource = "dev_chunk://dev_sky/left.png"
